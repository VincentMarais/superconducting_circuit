\mydef{Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC)}{In condensed matter physics, 
a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC) is a state of matter 
that is typically formed when a gas of bosons at very low densities 
is cooled to temperatures very close to absolute zero ($-273.15 ^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ or $-459.67 ^{\circ}\mathrm{F}$ 
or $0 \,\mathrm{K}$). Under such conditions, a large fraction of bosons occupy the same ground state.
